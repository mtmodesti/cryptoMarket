In this application, I tried to be as simple as possible.

In the main table, in the center of the page, you will see a list of 100 cryptocurrencies. Each currency represented in the row has 7 columns with the following information, respectively:

Position, symbol, abbreviation, unit price in dollars, percentage change in price in the last day and the value of transactions in the last 24 hours.

The table information is updated every 10ms.

You can search in the text field for any desired currency by name or abbreviation. All matches with the text field will be returned in the table.

In the box on the right, you enter a date and the name of the currency. A modal will be opened if the information is correct. Future dates, very distant pasts where information about the currency did not yet exist, or wrong names will show a modal stating that it was not possible to collect this information.
